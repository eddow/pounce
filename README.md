# Pounce

> A lightweight, reactive web framework ecosystem built with TypeScript and JSX

Pounce is a monorepo containing a collection of packages for building modern web applications with automatic reactivity, type safety, and minimal overhead.

## Ecosystem Status

- **[@pounce/core](./packages/core)**: The foundational reactive UI framework with JSX. It is **mostly done** and stable.
- **[@pounce/kit](./packages/kit)** & **[@pounce/ui](./packages/ui)**: Client utilities, routing, and UI components. These are **quite finished** and work seamlessly with their **[pico adapter](./packages/adapters/pico)**.
- **[@pounce/board](./packages/board)**: The full-stack meta-framework. It is currently undergoing a **complete rework** from the ground up and is not ready for general use at this time.

## 🌟 Features

- **🚀 Lightweight**: No virtual DOM, minimal overhead
- **⚡ Reactive**: Automatic reactivity powered by `mutts` reactivity engine
- **🔄 Two-Way Binding**: Automatic detection and setup of two-way data binding
- **🎨 JSX Support**: Write components using familiar JSX syntax
- **💪 Type-Safe**: Full TypeScript support with type safety
- **🧩 Component-Based**: Create reusable, composable components
- **📦 No Runtime Overhead**: Works directly with the DOM
